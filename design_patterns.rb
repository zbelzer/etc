# Creational Patterns

# Abstract Factory: Provide an interface for creating families of related or
# dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.


# Builder: Separate the construction of a complex object from its
# representation so that the same construction process can create different
# representations.


# Factory Method: Define an interface for creating an object, but let
# subclasses decide which class to instantiate. +Factory Method+ lets a class
# defer instantiation to subclasses.

# Prototype: Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical
# instance, and creating new objects by copying this prototype.


# Singleton: Ensure a class only has one instance and provide a global point of
# access to it.


# Structural Patterns

# Adapter: Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients
# expect.  Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because
# of incompatible interfaces.


# Bridge: Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can
# vary independently.


# Composite: Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole
# hierarchies.  +Composite+ lets clients treat individual objects and
# compositions of objects uniformly.


# Decorator: Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
# Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending
# functionality.


# Facade: Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
# Facade defines a higher level interface that makes the subsystem easier to
# use.


# Flyweight: Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects
# efficiently.


# Proxy: Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control
# access to it.


# Behavioral Patterns:

# Chain of Responsibility: Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its
# receiver by giving more than one chance to handle the request. Chain the
# receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object
# handles it.


# Command: Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize
# clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable
# operations.


# Interpreter: Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along
# with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in
# the language.


# Iterator: Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object
# sequentially without exposing the underlying representation.

# @example: Tree level-order


# Mediator: Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
# Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each
# other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently.


# Memento: Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an objects
# internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.


# Observer: Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one
# object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated
# automatically.


# State: Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
# The object will appear to change its class.


# Strategy: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them
# interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients
# that use it.


# Template Method: Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation,
# deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine
# certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithms structure.


# Visitor: Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object
# structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the
# classes of the elements on which it operates.
