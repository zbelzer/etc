# Creational Patterns
# =============================================================================

# Abstract Factory:
# Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects
# without specifying their concrete classes.
#
# Example in Ruby:
#
# In the wild:


# Builder:
# Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that
# the same construction process can create different representations.
#
# Example in Ruby:
#
# In the wild:


# Factory Method:
# Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which
# class to instantiate. +Factory Method+ lets a class defer instantiation to
# subclasses.
#
# Example in Ruby:
#
# In the wild:


# Prototype:
# Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and
# creating new objects by copying this prototype.
#
# Example in Ruby:
#
# In the wild:


# Singleton:
# Ensure a class only has one instance and provide a global point of access to
# it.
#
# Example in Ruby:
#
# In the wild:


# Structural Patterns
# =============================================================================

# Adapter:
# Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
# Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of
# incompatible interfaces.
#
# Example in Ruby:
#
# In the wild:


# Bridge:
# Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary
# independently.
#
# Example in Ruby:
#
# In the wild:


# Composite:
# Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
# +Composite+ lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects
# uniformly.
#
# Example in Ruby:
#
# In the wild:


# Decorator:
# Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.  Decorators
# provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
#
# Example in Ruby:
#
# In the wild:


# Facade:
# Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.  +Facade+
# defines a higher level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
#
# Example in Ruby:
#
# In the wild:


# Flyweight:
# Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.
#
# Example in Ruby:
#
# In the wild:


# Proxy:
# Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to
# it.
#
# Example in Ruby:
#
# In the wild:


# Behavioral Patterns:
# =============================================================================

# Chain of Responsibility:
# Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than
# one chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the
# request along the chain until an object handles it.
#
# Example in Ruby:
#
# In the wild:


# Command:
# Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients
# with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable
# operations.
#
# Example in Ruby:
#
# In the wild:


# Interpreter:
# Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an
# interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the
# language.
#
# Example in Ruby:
#
# In the wild:


# Iterator:
# Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially
# without exposing the underlying representation.
#
# Example in Ruby:
#
# In the wild:
# Tree level-order


# Mediator:
# Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.  Mediator
# promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other
# explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently.
#
# Example in Ruby:
#
# In the wild:


# Memento:
# Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an objects internal
# state so that the object can be restored to this state later.
#
# Example in Ruby:
#
# In the wild:


# Observer:
# Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object
# changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
#
# Example in Ruby:
#
# In the wild:


# State:
# Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.  The
# object will appear to change its class.
#
# Example in Ruby:
#
# In the wild:


# Strategy:
# Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them
# interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients
# that use it.
#
# Example in Ruby:
#
# In the wild:


# Template Method:
# Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to
# subclasses. +Template Method+ lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an
# algorithm without changing the algorithms structure.
#
# Example in Ruby:
#
# In the wild:


# Visitor:
# Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object
# structure. +Visitor+ lets you define a new operation without changing the
# classes of the elements on which it operates.
#
# Example in Ruby:
#
# In the wild:
#
